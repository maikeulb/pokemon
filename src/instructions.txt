Simple API wrapper that consumes pokeapi and caches the results with redis and
times the response time. Powered by Flask + Redis with minimum dependencies
(not using Flask-Cache). The two endpoints are api/pokemons and
api/pokemons/<int:id>.

Quickstart
First, make sure you have a local instance of Redis (Redis.py directly) and
configure config.py so that it points to your instance, then set FLASK_APP to
pokemon.py.

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ flask run
$ localhost:5000/api/pokemons

----
Alternatively:
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
$ localhost:8000/api/pokemons
